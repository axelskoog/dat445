Implement the function `kcals` for computing the amount of kilocalories in a receipe. The first argument of the function should be a dictionary which maps a product name to the number of kilocalories per unit. The second argument should be a list of tuples. The first element of each tuple is the quantity and the second element is the name of the product.

For example `kcals({'ägg': 137}, [(2,'ägg')])` should return `137*2=274` kilocalories for a receipe which includes only two eggs.
