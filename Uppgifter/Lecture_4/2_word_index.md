Implement the function `word_index` which takes a string and returns a dictionary which maps words to their positions. The positions are counted as number of words. All words are assumed to be separated by space.

Example: `word_index('the spider indexes the spider web')` must return `{'the': [0,3],'spider': [1,4], 'indexes': [2], 'web': [5]}`
