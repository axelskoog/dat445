One normal movie ticket costs 100 SEK, and for minors under 18 years, the price is 50 SEK. If the performance starts before 18:00, there is an additional 10% discount.

Implement the function `movieTickets(nrTickets, nrUnder18, time)`, which takes the number of tickets, the number of people under 18 and the starting and returns the total price for all tickets.
For example, `movieTickets(5, 3, 17)` should return `315`.
