We like to go out and enjoy the sun as much as we can, except when we have a meeting and must stay in.

Define a function such that `going_out(sunny, stay_in)` is `True` when it is time to go out, and `False` otherwise. The parameter sunny is `True` if the sun is shining, and the parameter `stay_in` is `True` when we can't go out.
