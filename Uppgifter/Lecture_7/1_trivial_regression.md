Linear regression is trivial when the training set contains just the two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) which uniquely determine a line with the equation:

![Triv. Regression](./1_trivial_regression.light.png#gh-light-mode-only)

Implement the function `trivial_regression(x1, y1, x2, y2, x)` which given the coordinates of the two points and a new x, returns the corresponding y.
