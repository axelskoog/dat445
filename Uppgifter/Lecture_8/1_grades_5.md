A certain CS professor gives 5-point quizzes that are graded on the scale 5 points for A, 4 points for B, 3 points for C, 2 points for D, and 0 to 1 points for F.

Write the function `grades` which given the number of points computes the grade. For example `grades(3)` should return the string `'C'`.
