A [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is a simple subscription cipher based on the idea of shifting each letter of the plaintext message a fixed number (called the key) of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the key is 2, then 'a' becomes 'c', 'b' becomes 'd', etc. When we reach the end of the alphabet, then we wrap around, i.e. 'y' becomes 'a' and 'z' becomes 'b'. If you apply the same cipher with a negative index, then if works as a decoder for an already encrypted message.

Implement the cipher as a function, i.e. `caesar(2, 'secret')` should return `'ugetgv'`. Make sure that when you shift the letters in the alphabet, you also wrap around. One way to do that is that when you compute the index of the shifted letter, you also check whether the index is negative or bigger than 25. Another way is to use modulus 26 (e.g. % 26 in Python).
