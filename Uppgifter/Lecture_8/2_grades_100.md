A certain CS professor gives 100-point exams that are graded on the scale 90-100 points for A, 80-89 points for B, 70-79 points for C, 60-69 points for D, and less than 60 points for F.

Write the function `grades` which given the number of points computes the grade. For example `grades(65)` should return the string `'D'`.
