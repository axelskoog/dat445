Numerologists claim to be able to determine a person's character based on the "numeric value" of a name. The value of a name is determined by summing up the values of the letters where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, 'c' is 3, up to 'z' being 26.

Implement the function `numeric_value` for computing the number, e.g. `numeric_value('Alice')` should return `30`.
