When taking a loan for buying an apartment or a house the following rules apply:

* If the loan is 70% or more of the total property price, 2% of the loan must be paid back to the bank per year.
* If the loan is 50% or more of the total property price, 1% of the loan must be paid back to the bank per year.
* If the loan is less than 50% of the total property price, the buyer doesn’t pay back the loan, but he/she must still pay bank interest.

Every bank has a rate in percentages which states how much interest must be paid for the loan per year. Write a function `calculate_loan(property_price, loan, interest_rate)` which when executed calculates and prints the expenses for the loan. The arguments of the function are the property price, the loan and the interest rate in percentages, and it must print back how much of the loan must be paid back (amortized) per month, the size of the monthly interest, and finally the total monthly expenses.

Note:​ the rules in the first paragraph are all stated per year, while you must print the expenses per month, i.e. you need to divide by 12.
